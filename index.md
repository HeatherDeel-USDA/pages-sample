## Welcome everyone to my spiffy site!


#### Here are some example pages:

Why did you bring us here?
Is that a cooking show? Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! She also liked to shut up! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Ummm…to eBay?
I love you, buddy! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?

Anyone who laughs is a communist!
They're like sex, except I'm having them!
Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
Then we'll go with that data file! Soothe us with sweet lies. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Kif might!

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!
Professor, make a woman out of me.
Well, then good news! It's a suppository.
Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Say what? We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

Bender?! You stole the atom. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. You are the last hope of the universe.

I'll get my kit! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

No. We're on the top. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! We're also Santa Claus! Why would I want to know that?

What are their names? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. And then the battle's not so bad? It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.

Yes! In your face, Gandhi! And I'm his friend Jesus. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! But existing is basically all I do! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Shinier than yours, meatbag.

No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Say what? Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!
